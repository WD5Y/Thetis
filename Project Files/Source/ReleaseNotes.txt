The minimum Edge Length is 15ms which, based upon testing, is required to meet the new ARRL Guidelines.  However, due to the edge shape, a 15ms total edge yields about 5ms in the range of 10% - 90% amplitude, i.e., the 15ms number is a bit misleading.
- [add] New NR features: (1) the "Trained" gain method as described below, (2) an alternative Noise Power Estimation method called "NSTAT" which should have a faster response to changing noise levels, and (3) code added in the AE Filter that removes an annoying rumble that could occasionally occur.
- ["Trained"] The new "Trained" NR has a file (zetaHat.bin). It is a data file that contains the essential information extracted from "training" the algorithm.

- [change] forced the bpfs bypass check to be on as default
- [change] simplification improvements to db import
- [change] noise floor approximation now enters 'fast attack' mode more frequently for quicker floor detection (changing modes/antennas/etc)
- [change] the dB shift setting for AGC auto noise floor compensation is now a true shift from NF. You will probably need to tweak your previous setting
- [change] the shutdown log is defaulted off. Use command line param -logshutdown to cause Thetis to create a shutdown_log.txt file if you are having shutdown issues which can then be sent in for analysis
- [fix] fix issue where you could not remove tx profile entries if they only had case changes in their name, such as ABc and abc
- [fix] import of container locations now works when importing a database
- [fix] fixed issue where a meter container would re-appear if console was minimised and then restored and that container had been docked at some point
- [fix] exporting a tx profile no longer exports schema for non tx profile tables
- [fix] fixed issue where a bandstack entry could be duped if ignore dupe was turned on after there were duplicated frequencies in the stack already
- [fix] dragging a container on the RX# in the titlebar would cause a jump/offset from the mouse pointer
- [fix] band change is prevented in most cases when in the middle of TX. Split/Swap/TX is not prevented, so beware
- [fix] rx att + tx att was being used in dup display, leading to incorrect display. Fixed
- [fix] comp meter when used in rx2 shows the correct rx1 values
- [fix] fixed issue with %vfoasub% showing at incorrect states
- [fix] fixed autostart process flag issue that caused DDUtil_v3 to start incorrectly
- [fix] fixed issue at startup or where diversity form is initially shown where no gain is applied if the gain is locked. This would be noticeable with the 'control dot' being centred. Many other fixes in the diversity system
- [fix] fixed issue where 'bad' characters in an autostarter path would cause a crash at start up
- [fix] fixed issue where AGC gains would not be stored correctly and/or could be spread to other bands if different agc modes (slow/med/long etc) were configured for use on those bands
- [fix] fixed issue introduced with the re-work of tx-att in dev_4. The spectrum when tx'ing with duplex enabled is now adjusted by the tx attenuation.
- [fix] small change to auto start exe code to fix issue with command line args
- [fix] decouple of the rx1/rx2 attenuator preamp/s-att boxes from tx-att. New tx-att control, and bg colour settings in appearance (github #399)
- [fix] multimeters would sometimes not bottom to low values out when power off, and other rare occurrences. Now resolved
- [fix] changes to fix issue #407, No TX output when initially going to QSK

- [fix] corrected character display issues in input/output combo boxes (Issue #420)
- [fix] websocket protocol close frame message is now sent when TCIserver disconnects a client, preventing some third-party clients from closing improperly
- [fix] reworked TCIserver input message buffer to prevent random client disconnects when TCI WebSocket messages arrive rapidly
- [fix] vac mic audio source can now be recorded
- [fix] split TXing out of a ham band will no longer disable split when extended mode is used. Note: 'Prevent TX when on different band to RX' option will be used if enabled and TX band has been moved for bandpass/lpf purposes (ie when tx'ing on 11m)
- [fix] output power on ANT ports configured as RX only should be resolved. Requires an update to your firmware. See the [ApacheLab community forums here](https://community.apache-labs.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=4972)
