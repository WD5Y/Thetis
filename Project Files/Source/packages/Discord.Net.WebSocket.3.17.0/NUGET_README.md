## üõë Known Issues

### WebSockets (Win7 and earlier)

.NET Core 1.1 does not support WebSockets on Win7 and earlier.
This issue has been fixed since the release of .NET Core 2.1.
It is recommended to target .NET Core 2.1 or above for your project if you wish to run your bot on legacy platforms;
alternatively, you may choose to install the
[Discord.Net.Providers.WS4Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Discord.Net.Providers.WS4Net/) package.

### TLS on .NET Framework.

Discord supports only TLS1.2+ on all their websites including the API since 07/19/2022.
.NET Framework does not support this protocol by default.
If you depend on .NET Framework, it is suggested to upgrade your project to `net6-windows`.
This framework supports most of the windows-only features introduced by fx, and resolves startup errors from the TLS protocol mismatch.
