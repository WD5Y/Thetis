1) Added "Amp Pwr Lim" checkbox on the OC tab in setup; lets you set hard limits on both the drive and tune sliders. This will toggle the radio xmit and xPA to off and move the
   associated slider or sliders to zero, then show a window to inform the operator to reset slider values. This works before any power is transmitted to ensure amp safety.

2) Added memory tabs to save "AGC Auto" funtion, saves you from having to re-enter auto agc when moving to another memory.

3) Added values to the sliders along with buttons to "Gain" form in the "Andromeda Button Bar" selection in collapsed view.

4) Linked sliders in the Andromeda Gain form.

5) Cleaned up some anomalies / issues in Collapsed view.
