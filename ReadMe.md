An improved version of Thetis, particularly with regard to VAC latency.


--- Currently there are no releases available ----
This is because of internal code re-organisation, so
please be patient
-------

Please note that this repo uses (almost) best-practice 
with regard to version numbers. Why almost? See below:


Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
Summary:
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

 - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
 - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
 - PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Why almost? Well, for some reason, the community has been used to the revision number only changing on 
a major release! This is a WTF for me.

As a temporary compromise, I am currently incrementing the .PATCH  (also known as the revision) on each
and every change, and I have not changed the MINOR (as I would have done normally). I just don't want
to frighten people, but, get used to it, folks, because things are a-changing and the next flurry of
releases will conform exactly to Semantic Versioning, as they should have done all along.
You can find out more about this at: https://semver.org/





My fork includes many improvements to the VAC system, and allies HL2 (Hermes-Lite 2) usage with the Apache-Labs ones.
